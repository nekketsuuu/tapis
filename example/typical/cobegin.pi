  An example taken from Kobayashi's paper about information flow analysis.
  The process below implements:
    cobegin
        (secret1:=true; send(c, nil))
       | let _ = receive(c) in secret2:=!secret1
    coend;
    public := false
 ***/
new secret1 in new secret2 in new c in new cont1 in new cont2 in
  secret1!false |
  secret2!false |
  secret1?b.(secret1!true | c!().cont1!()) |
  c?z.secret1?b.(secret1!b | secret2?z.(secret2!b | cont2!())) |
  cont1?z.cont2?z.public?b.public!false
